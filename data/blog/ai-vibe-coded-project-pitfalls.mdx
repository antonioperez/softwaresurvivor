# The Pitfalls of AI Vibe-Coded Projects in Production

Over the last year I have been called in to rescue more than a few "vibe-coded" AI projects—proofs of concept that felt magical during a demo but fractured the moment they touched real users. The energy in those early experiments is exciting, yet shipping to production is less about vibes and more about disciplined engineering. Let’s walk through the common pitfalls and talk about how my consulting practice helps teams cross the finish line with confidence.

## 1. Unstable Foundations Disguised as Momentum

A vibe-coded prototype usually leans on duct-taped scripts, generous manual oversight, and a few lucky prompts. That momentum is deceptive: once traffic spikes or business stakeholders ask for repeatable results, the cracks appear. Inputs drift, models hallucinate, and manual steps become overnight bottlenecks.

**How I help:** I start with a production readiness audit that inventories every API call, data dependency, and manual workflow. Together we lock down a reliable baseline so the rest of the project stands on solid ground.

## 2. Missing Observability and Guardrails

Rapid-fire experiments rarely include telemetry, alerting, or a risk mitigation plan. In production, that translates to teams discovering failures from angry tweets or customer support tickets. Worse, unmonitored AI behavior can lead to compliance violations or brand damage.

**How I help:** I instrument your pipelines with tracing, evaluation dashboards, and human-in-the-loop workflows. When something drifts, you’ll see it before customers do—and you’ll know what knob to turn.

## 3. Fragile Prompting and Data Pipelines

Early prototypes survive on a handful of curated examples and hero prompts. In production, inputs diversify and the model’s behavior becomes inconsistent. Data contracts that were never written down get broken by the first upstream schema change.

**How I help:** I work with your team to codify prompts, build regression test suites, and implement robust data validation. Your model stays resilient even when the world around it changes.

## 4. Overlooked Security and Compliance

It’s easy to forget about secret management, access controls, and auditing when the goal is “just a demo.” Unfortunately regulators, customers, and procurement teams expect full accountability before signing off on an AI product.

**How I help:** I align your system with security best practices—role-based access, encrypted storage, vendor risk reviews—so legal and compliance stakeholders can approve the launch without hesitation.

## 5. Team Burnout and Scope Creep

When the prototype falters, engineers scramble to patch holes while leaders pile on new feature requests. Morale dips, weekends vanish, and suddenly the project misses its launch window.

**How I help:** I facilitate roadmap resets that prioritize the smallest valuable release. We establish clear ownership, cadence, and feedback loops so the team can move fast without burning out.

## Bringing Your AI Project Across the Finish Line

Shipping AI to production requires more than enthusiasm; it demands pragmatic architecture, trustworthy data, and an empathetic approach to change management. That blend of technical rigor and people-first guidance is where my consulting services shine.

If you’re staring at a vibe-coded AI prototype that needs to become a reliable product, let’s chat. I’d love to pair with your team, shore up the infrastructure, and launch something we’re all proud of. [Reach out through the contact form](/contact) and we’ll schedule a friendly discovery call.

_Together, we can turn AI vibes into production-grade victories._
