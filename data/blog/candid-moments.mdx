## ðŸŽ‰ Never Miss a Memory Again: How Candid Moments Makes Event Photo Sharing Effortless

Planning an event is hard enough. Chasing down photos afterward? That's a whole new headache.

You host an amazing nightâ€”guests snap hundreds of great photos and videosâ€”but they get buried in texts, DMs, email threads, or never sent at all. You're left with a couple blurry selfies and zero video of your favorite moment.

**Candid Moments changes that.**
