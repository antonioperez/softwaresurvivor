# 🚀 Building Inbox2Order: Transforming Email Inquiries into Automated Orders

Every day, businesses receive countless emails from customers wanting to place orders, request quotes, or inquire about products. The manual process of reading each email, extracting order details, and entering them into a system is time-consuming, error-prone, and doesn't scale.

**That's why we're building Inbox2Order**—an intelligent automation platform that transforms email inquiries into structured orders automatically.

## 📧 The Problem: Email Overload Meets Manual Data Entry

For many businesses, especially in e-commerce, custom manufacturing, and service industries, email remains a primary channel for order inquiries. The workflow typically looks like this:

1. Customer sends an email with order details
2. Staff member reads and interprets the email
3. Information is manually extracted and entered into an order management system
4. Order is processed and confirmed

This process is:
- **Slow**: Each email requires human attention
- **Error-prone**: Manual data entry leads to mistakes
- **Not scalable**: As volume grows, so does the workload
- **Expensive**: Staff time is consumed on repetitive tasks

## 💡 The Solution: Intelligent Email-to-Order Automation

Inbox2Order solves this by using AI and natural language processing to:
