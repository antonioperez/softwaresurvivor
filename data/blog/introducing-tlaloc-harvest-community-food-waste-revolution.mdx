# 🌿 Introducing Tlaloc Harvest: Your Community-Powered Food Waste Revolution Starts Here

In a world where billions of pounds of edible food are wasted every year, it's easy to feel like the problem is too big to solve. But what if the solution was already growing in your neighborhood, in your backyard garden, at your local farmers market—or sitting untouched in your fridge?

🚀 Meet **Tlaloc Harvest**: a tech-powered, community-driven movement to eliminate food waste and build a sustainable future together.

## 🌧 Why “Tlaloc Harvest”?

Named after **Tlaloc**, the Aztec god of rain and abundance, our mission is rooted in the belief that food is sacred, and no bite should go to waste. We're here to create a modern harvest—a platform where surplus becomes support, waste becomes wellness, and neighbors become allies in sustainability.

## 🧩 What We're Solving

Food waste isn't just a kitchen problem, it's a global crisis with environmental, social, and economic consequences. Tlaloc Harvest tackles this head-on by connecting:

- 🌱 Residents with extra produce  
- 🚛 Logistics teams ready to redistribute it  
- 🛍️ Retailers and farmers markets wanting to do good  
- 🧑‍🏫 Schools, nonprofits, and local governments  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Volunteers who want to make an impact  

All in one intuitive app.

## 📱 The App That's More Than Just a Marketplace

Tlaloc Harvest isn't just a tool—it's an experience. Users can:

- Share or donate surplus food  
- Coordinate pickups with optimized logistics  
- Earn points and rewards through sustainable actions  
- Access exclusive discounts at local farmers markets  
- Track their CO₂ reduction and community impact  
- Join workshops, events, and a vibrant green community  

## 💡 Who's It For?

Everyone. But especially:

- 🌇 Residents within a 5-mile community radius  
- 🧑‍💼 Companies eager to lead with CSR  
- 🚚 Coordinators and drivers seeking smart routes  
- 🌽 Farmers markets looking for more foot traffic  
- 🧒 Teachers and nonprofits wanting to educate and activate  

## 💸 How We Sustain the Harvest

We're building a regenerative revenue model with:

- Corporate partnerships and CSR sponsorships  
- Logistics coordination tools  
- Farmers market collaborations  
- Community subscriptions  
- Grants, fundraising, and in-app events  

This isn't just a feel-good project, it's a sustainable, scalable model built for longevity.

## 🌎 Our Vision

We're not stopping at food. Tlaloc Harvest is laying the foundation for **the next generation of civic engagement and sustainable tech**. Think climate gamification, hyperlocal ecosystems, and empowered citizens taking the lead in their communities.
