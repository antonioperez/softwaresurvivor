Antonio Perez is a senior backend architect and engineering leader with 10+ years of experience helping startups and retail brands build scalable, reliable systems that just work. He specializes in backend infrastructure, API platforms, cloud architecture, and complex system migrations—with a focus on delivering clean solutions without downtime.

Antonio has led engineering for high-growth companies like Target and Pressed Juicery, where he:

- Scaled APIs to handle 20M+ requests/month  
- Migrated 10M+ loyalty records live across systems  
- Rolled out unified POS and e-commerce platforms across 100+ locations  
- Reduced API onboarding time from 7 days to 30 minutes  

From modernizing legacy platforms (MongoDB to Postgres, Stripe to Braintree) to designing secure, event-driven architectures on AWS (ECS, Terraform, CodePipeline), Antonio brings deep technical expertise paired with a calm, execution-first mindset.

He now works with technical teams as a fractional architect, migration specialist, or high-trust partner to tackle the hardest backend challenges—whether you’re scaling up, cleaning up, or replatforming.
