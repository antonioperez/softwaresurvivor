Antonio Perez is a senior engineering leader with over a decade of experience designing and scaling backend systems, cloud infrastructure, and API platforms for high-growth companies. His work spans mission-critical systems including e-commerce platforms, retail point-of-sale integrations, loyalty programs managing 10M+ balances, and real-time data pipelines.

He has led full-system migrations from MongoDB to Postgres, Stripe to Braintree, and Reaction Commerce to Shopify—executed without downtime. Antonio is deeply fluent in AWS architecture (ECS, Terraform, CodePipeline), secure internal platforms, GraphQL and REST APIs, and scalable event-driven infrastructure.

Previously a Lead Engineer at Target and Sr. Principal Engineer at Pressed Juicery, he now collaborates with technical teams to modernize legacy systems, reduce operational overhead, and deliver reliable cloud-native solutions.

Antonio is based in Fresno, CA and works remotely with engineering teams across the U.S. When he’s not building systems or mentoring developers, he’s likely experimenting with AI storytelling or hiking the Sierra backcountry.
